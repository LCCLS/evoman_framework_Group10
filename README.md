Evoman is a video game playing framework to be used as a testbed for optimization algorithms.

**To run NEAT experiment:**

1. create a directory in which you want to clone the github repository.
2. open you terminal and go into the directory you just created using: cd --filepath to the directory--
3. once you are in the directory, in the terminal copy/paste: git clone https://github.com/LCCLS/evoman_framework_Group10.git

- now you have the cloned repository in your folder :-) what you want to do now is create a virtualenv or conda environment to install all requirements. 

4. create a virtualenv or conda environment -- if youre using pycharm obviously you can also do that in there under preferences
5. once that is done and the environment is activated, you should navigate to the evoman_framework_Group10.git directory if youre not already there 
6. in the terminal run: "pip install -r requirements.txt" ;or if youre using conda, maybe first install pip using conda install pip. 
7. installing the requirements should occur without any errors, so if something goes wrong first solve the error before proceeding 
8. after successfully installing all requirements, run the neat_specialist.py file by either running it in an IDE or on your terminal using python3 neat-specialist.py 
9. make sure your computer settings dont allow the computer to sleep or otherwise the experiment will stop prematurely, also make sure its plugged in.
